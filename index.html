                    <h3>New Interface - 09/8/2020</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I have made a new interface, and I think it looks a lot better than
                        the old one. This one has more rounded corners, solid boxes, and it just
                        looks better. I hope you like it! It also should be mobile friendly now.

                        This is no longer going to be used as a blog, and will be used as a news
                        thing for the startpage or something.

                    <h3>YouTube sucks - 28/7/2020</h3>
                    <p>
                        I hate how YouTube does things nowadays. For example, today I was watching
                        a video. YouTube is already known for their trash recommendations, but
                        now I actually got an interesting recommendation. Around it was a blue
                        border that said "Rate this recommendation from 1 to 5" or something like
                        that. <b>I didn't want to rate the recommendation.</b> I tried to click
                        on the video, but it didn't let me. It said "Rate the recommendation and
                        then you get to watch the video." WHAT THE HELL, YOUTUBE? How do I rate
                        a recommendation when I don't know what's in the video other than from
                        the thumbnail and title, which can often be misleading, and then I thought
                        "Fine. I am going to 'rate' this recommendation." Then, guess what? It
                        <b>DID NOT LET ME WATCH THE VIDEO!</b> It completely hid the video. There
                        was no way for me to watch the video. So, lets recap:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>I click the video</li>
                            <li>YouTube wants (forces) me to rate it and then watch it</li>
                            <li>I rate it</li>
                            <li>YouTube takes away the video</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This makes absolutely no sense. YouTube, Please fix your website :)</p>
